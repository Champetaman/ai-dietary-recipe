# Recetario Inteligente

Recetario Inteligente is a web application that suggests recipes based on user-selected parameters such as time of day, food type, dietary restrictions, and religious diet. The app is built with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and utilizes the Vercel AI SDK to connect to OpenAI's GPT model for generating recipe suggestions.

## Features

- **Time Selection**: Choose the time of day for which you need a recipe (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).
- **Food Type Selection**: Select the type of cuisine you prefer (e.g., Italian, Chinese, Mexican).
- **Dietary Restrictions**: Optionally select any dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).
- **Religious Diets**: Optionally select any religious dietary restrictions.
- **Recipe Suggestion**: Get a recipe suggestion based on your selections, including the recipe name, ingredients and instructions.
- **Reset Functionality**: Clear all selections and restart the process.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
